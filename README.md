### What is that??? 🧐
Simple Java project where I document the solutions
I find for some challenges taken from codewars.com

### Getting started 🚀

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lorenzoalessi/codewars-algorithms.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
```

Then, you can access all the algorithms solutions or add yours!

### Project structure 🏫

```shell
.
├── src
│   └── algorithm-name              # Each algorithms folder name
│       ├── code                    # Folder containing the algorithm code
│       │   └── name                # Coder's name folder containing his solutions and unit tests
│       └── README.md               # Each algorithms README file that shows instructions
├── .gitignore                      # gitignore file
├── LICENSE                         # License file
└── README.md                       # README file
```

### Testing 🧪

All unit tests are located with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them.
The project uses JUnit for unit testing.

### Add solutions ⬆️

You can easily add an algorithm by creating the folder containing README and implementation (your code and unit test).

`N.B. Remember to follow the project structure shown above.`
